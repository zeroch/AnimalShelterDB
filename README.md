I am doing a house keeping for my repos. I even don't realize this repo. 
I've done this while I am taking Database class, so I have to complete this project all MySQL design and queries in a week. What is funny that two of my partner who suppose to work, but never show up. I have to learn php, which I never know before, to complete this assignment. I still learn a lot on this class tho, even I am not working with DataBase anymore. I still can remember some Database query command. haha.
